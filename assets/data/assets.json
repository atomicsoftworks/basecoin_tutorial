Because the price of Dai is pegged to the US Dollar, it experiences relatively little market volatility. As a result, it is most often used as a method of payment or hedging mechanism. Every Dai is backed by a surplus of collateral that is escrowed into publicly reviewable Ethereum smart contracts.
